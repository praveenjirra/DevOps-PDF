Download CLI from WebConsole with "?".
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/4.1/linux/oc.tar.gz

Xtract the file : tar -xvzf oc.tar.gz
place it in:    mv oc /usr/local/bin
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oc
oc login https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com --token=<hidden>
oc new-project <project-Name>
oc new-app <dockerhub image path> --name <appName>    ---> eg oc new-app manee2k6/python-app:1.0 --name python-app

A new app called python-app is created based on the manee2k6/python-app:1.0 image. After running the previous command, 
a new pod running the previous image + a service +  a replication controller is created.

After that, we need to create a route so the service is available to the public Internet.

oc expose svc python-app --name=pyapp

To update new version of image:
oc import-image python-app:1.1 --from=manee2k6/python-app:1.1 

To delete an app in the project use the below command
oc delete all -l app=appName
